## [about me]
Hello, my name is Noah Dinan and I recently graduated from Ronald Reagan College Prep High School with Valedictorian honors. I am an FRC alumni from [FIRST Robotics Team 1675](https://frc1675.com). I plan to attend MSOE for Software Engineering in the fall.

Check out my [resume](https://shinysocks.net/share/resume.pdf)!

I ❤️ cats, computer programming, singing, and gaming on linux! I've recently been playing: Generation Zero, Rain World, Barony, Magic: The Gathering, Overwatch and Barotrauma

## [skills & interests]

![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=linux,python,java,git,bash,docker,unity,cs,rust,react,js&perline=6)

On my personal laptop, I daily drive Debian and have enjoyed configuring and customizing it while learning my way around a linux environment. Recently, I've been loving the [helix](https://helix-editor.com) modal editor.

shinysocks.net is hosted on github pages, check out the code here: [shinysocks/shinysocks.net](https://github.com/shinysocks/shinysocks.net)
and [radio.shinysocks.net](https://radio.shinysocks.net) is tunneled to a web server on my laptop (and has accordingly unreliable uptime).

## [projects]
### [modulartelebot](https://github.com/shinysocks/modulartelebot)
*Spring 2024*

Created an extensible telegram bot using Java's OOP principles with my friend [Michael Shalewski](https://github.com/jagernet-ops).

### [maths ia](https://shinysocks.net/share/maths.pdf)
*Winter 2024*

For my IB Mathematics Internal Assessment I explored modeling the theoretical and experimental time complexity for the Bubble Sort algorithm.

### [cliradio](https://github.com/shinysocks/cliradio)
*Winter 2024*

For the IB Computer Science Internal Assessment I wrote a commandline audio streaming program in Java. It allows users to stream audio from either a microphone or internally (with Pipewire) over a LAN.

### [robotics](https://github.com/frc1675/frc1675-2024)
*Winter 2024*

As my first robotics build season begins, I've learned how to do high-fidelity prototyping on a potential manipulator for the robot.

### [ticktacktoe](https://shinysocks.net/share/ticktacktoe.jar)
*Fall 2023*

To practice using Java's Swing framework, I created a version of tic-tac-toe with claymation.

### [couriercat](https://shinysocks.itch.io/couriercat)
*Summer & Fall 2023*

couriercat is my second collaborative game project. This simple exploration game was built in the Unity game engine for Android and WebGL. Check it out on itch.io.

### [oozing](https://shinysocks.itch.io/oozing)
*Summer 2022*

OOZING is an odd little game where you play as a cat with a cannon. This was a small collaborative game built using the Unity Game Engine and C# with a group of friends.

### [chatGPT-discord-bot](https://github.com/Zero6992/chatGPT-discord-bot)
*Spring/Summer 2022*

I was interested in creating a discord bot that allowed a user to interact with chatgpt's various [jailbreaks](https://www.jailbreakchat.com). I decided to fork Zero6992's chatGPT-discord-bot and add personas as well as image generation.

### [raccoonundrum](https://shinysocks.itch.io/raccoonundrum)
*Fall 2021*

Raccoonundrum, written in Python with the Pygame library, was one of my first large coding projects built for the IB Middle Years Programme personal project.

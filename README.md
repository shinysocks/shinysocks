## [about me]
Hello, my name is Noah Dinan and I am a senior at Ronald Reagan College Prep High School. I am a part of the IB full Diploma Programme and [FIRST Robotics Team 1675](https://frc1675.com). I plan to either attend MSOE for Computer Engineering after high school graduation.

Check out my [resume](https://shinysocks.net/share/resume.pdf)!

I ❤️ cats, computer programming, singing, and gaming on linux! Some of my favorite games are Terraria, Inscryption, Outer Wilds, Stray, Baldur's Gate 3, Night in the Woods, and Barony.

## [skills & interests]

On my personal laptop, I daily drive Debian and have enjoyed configuring and customizing it while learning my way around a linux environment. Recently, I've been loving the [helix](https://helix-editor.com) modal editor.

I currently host this site on rocket.rs & docker on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. Check out the code on github: [shinysocks/shinysocks.net](https://github.com/shinysocks/shinysocks.net)

## [projects]

### [maths ia](https://shinysocks.net/share/maths.pdf)
*Winter 2024*

For my IB Mathematics Internal Assessment I explored modeling the theoretical and experimental time complexity for the Bubble Sort algorithm.

### [cliradio](https://github.com/shinysocks/cliradio#cliradio)
*Winter 2024*

For the IB Computer Science Internal Assessment I wrote a commandline audio streaming program in Java. It allows users to stream audio from either a microphone or internally (with Pipewire) over a LAN.

### [robotics](https://github.com/frc1675/frc1675-2024)
*Winter 2024*

As my first robotics build season begins, I've learned how to do high-fidelity prototyping on a potential manipulator for the robot.
[Side-Wheel Prototype](https://shinysocks.net/share/prototypelog.pdf)

### [ticktacktoe](https://shinysocks.net/share/ticktacktoe.jar)
*Fall 2023*

To practice using Java's Swing framework, I created a version of tic-tac-toe with claymation.

### [couriercat](https://shinysocks.itch.io/couriercat)
*Summer & Fall 2023*

couriercat is my second collaborative game project. This simple exploration game was built in the Unity game engine for Android and WebGL. Check it out on itch.io.

### [oozing](https://shinysocks.itch.io/oozing)
*Summer 2022*

OOZING is an odd little game where you play as a cat with a cannon. This was a small collaborative game built using the Unity Game Engine and C# with a group of friends.

### [chatGPT-discord-bot](https://github.com/Zero6992/chatGPT-discord-bot)
*Spring/Summer 2022*

I was interested in creating a discord bot that allowed a user to interact with chatgpt's various [jailbreaks](https://www.jailbreakchat.com). I decided to fork Zero6992's chatGPT-discord-bot and add personas as well as image generation.

### [raccoonundrum](https://shinysocks.itch.io/raccoonundrum)
*Fall 2021*

Raccoonundrum, written in Python with the Pygame library, was one of my first large coding projects built for the IB Middle Years Programme personal project.
